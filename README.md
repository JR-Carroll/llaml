# llaml
Lights, Lights, and More Lights

## Requirements
It can be a little tricky to install LLaML in the beginnig because there is no `setup.py` or wheel at this time, but if you are handy with your distros package manager tools it shouldn't be too difficult!

* Linux distro (I build/develop on Debian)
* Python 2+ (but <3.0; port to 3 not yet planned, still finishing Python 2 implementation, maybe in 10+ years... =P)
* PySide (Qt4 bindings)
  To install PySide, one often needs the following as pre-reqs:
  * CMake (to compile PySide)
  * Qmake (qt4-qmake)
  * QT4-default
  * Alternatively, if you can find a wheel/pip of a binary of pyside, ultimately that's all you need.
